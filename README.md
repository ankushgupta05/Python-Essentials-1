# Note:- CPython kya hai?
 ```
CPython is the implementation of Python language â€” basically, itâ€™s the actual software that runs your Python code.

CPython is written in C language, iska naam bhi isi wajah se "CPython" rakha gaya hai.

Jab aap terminal me python ya python3 likh ke code run karte ho, toh aap asal me CPython interpreter hi chala rahe hote ho.

Ye implementation Python ke rules (syntax, behavior) ko follow karta hai â€” jaise PSF (Python Software Foundation) ne define kiya hai.

ðŸ’¡ Think of CPython as the engine that powers your Python programs.
```


# Note:- Python 2
```
print "Hello World"  # No parentheses
```

# Note:- Python 3
```
print("Hello World")  # Parentheses required
```


# Note :- CPython kya hai
```
CPython is the original and official implementation of the Python programming language.
It is written in the C language and maintained by the Python Software Foundation (PSF).
Jab aap terminal me python ya python3 likhte ho, aap mostly CPython hi chala rahe hote ho.
Ye sabse stable, popular aur widely supported version hai
