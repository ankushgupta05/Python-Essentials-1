# Note:- CPython kya hai?
 ```
CPython is the implementation of Python language â€” basically, itâ€™s the actual software that runs your Python code.

CPython is written in C language, iska naam bhi isi wajah se "CPython" rakha gaya hai.

Jab aap terminal me python ya python3 likh ke code run karte ho, toh aap asal me CPython interpreter hi chala rahe hote ho.

Ye implementation Python ke rules (syntax, behavior) ko follow karta hai â€” jaise PSF (Python Software Foundation) ne define kiya hai.

ðŸ’¡ Think of CPython as the engine that powers your Python programs.
```


# Note:- Python 2
```
print "Hello World"  # No parentheses
```

# Note:- Python 3
```
print("Hello World")  # Parentheses required
```


# Note :- CPython kya hai
```
CPython is the original and official implementation of the Python programming language.
It is written in the C language and maintained by the Python Software Foundation (PSF).
Jab aap terminal me python ya python3 likhte ho, aap mostly CPython hi chala rahe hote ho.
Ye sabse stable, popular aur widely supported version hai
```



## Note :-
```
ðŸ’¬ Summary in One Line Each:
âœ… CPython â€“ Official and most-used Python interpreter.

ðŸš€ Cython â€“ Make Python code faster by compiling to C.

â˜• Jython â€“ Use Python in Java apps (runs on JVM).

âš¡ PyPy â€“ Fastest Python using Just-in-Time compiler.

ðŸ§© MicroPython â€“ Run Python on small hardware devices (IoT).
```





## Python Implementations Comparison

| **Implementation** | **Purpose / Use Case** | **Special Features** | **Example** |
|--------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| **CPython (C-language Python)** | âœ… Most commonly used and official version of Python<br>âœ… Suitable for everyday development like web development, scripting, automation, etc. | ðŸ”¹ Written in C programming language<br>ðŸ”¹ Maintained by Python Software Foundation (PSF)<br>ðŸ”¹ Supports almost all Python libraries and tools | ðŸ“Œ Basic Python usage:<br>`print("Hello from CPython")`<br>ðŸ“Œ Used in: Django, Flask, Jupyter, etc. |
| **Cython (C-Extension Python)** | âœ… Used to increase performance of Python code, especially useful in scientific computing, loops, data processing, and machine learning | ðŸ”¹ Converts Python code into C language for speed<br>ðŸ”¹ Offers optional static typing<br>ðŸ”¹ Helps write hybrid Python + C programs | ðŸ“Œ Example (Cython function):<br>```cython<br>cpdef int fast_square(int x):<br>    return x * x```<br>ðŸ“Œ Used in: Pandas, Scikit-learn, NumPy |
| **Jython (Java Python)** | âœ… Lets you write Python code that runs on Java Virtual Machine (JVM)<br>âœ… Useful when you want to integrate with Java code or use Java libraries | ðŸ”¹ Written in Java language<br>ðŸ”¹ Allows Python scripts to interact with Java classes, GUIs, frameworks<br>ðŸ”¹ Works well in Java-based enterprise environments | ðŸ“Œ Java GUI using Python:<br>```python<br>from java.awt import Frame<br>f = Frame("Hello Jython")<br>f.setVisible(True)``` |
| **PyPy (Python Python â€“ Just-in-Time Compiler)** | âœ… Best for CPU-heavy and performance-critical applications like games, simulations, web scraping | ðŸ”¹ Uses JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler to run Python code much faster<br>ðŸ”¹ No code change needed â€” just use PyPy instead of Python<br>ðŸ”¹ Compatible with most Python 3 code | ðŸ“Œ Run script with PyPy:<br>`pypy myscript.py`<br>ðŸ“Œ Used for: speed optimization without code rewriting |
| **MicroPython (Microcontroller Python)** | âœ… Used in embedded systems, IoT (Internet of Things), hardware-level programming<br>âœ… Runs on tiny devices like sensors, boards, microcontrollers | ðŸ”¹ Lightweight Python interpreter (very small memory footprint)<br>ðŸ”¹ Works on microchips like ESP32, Raspberry Pi Pico, Arduino<br>ðŸ”¹ Designed for real-time low-power devices | ðŸ“Œ Control LED on ESP32:<br>```python<br>from machine import Pin<br>led = Pin(2, Pin.OUT)<br>led.value(1)```<br>ðŸ“Œ Used in: Smart home gadgets, Wearables, Sensors |
